## 25600X Tower Takeover Code

I spent some time making a nice UI for the screen, showing a visual for the five autonomous options: the four starting field positions or no autonomous (simply press whichever one is green to deselect it). I also added four different readouts graphing the positions of the arm and rack as well as the speeds of the drivetrain (left side is red, right side is green, meaning a spike upward of red indicates that the robot is turning right and vice versa) and the intake.
